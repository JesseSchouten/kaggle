#  Description
This repository consists of two demo kaggle competition participations from my time at university. Please read the folders for more info.
# Results
VU - Flight delay prediction does not yield a summary of results. VU - Personalize Expedia Hotel Searches yields a report from the findings in the competition in VU - Personalize Expedia Hotel Searches/reports/Report.pdf
# Methodology used
VU - Flight delay prediction was a simple classification problem, with the target class being whether a flight was delayed or not. This was solved using several Tree-based models including Random Forest, XGBoost and Light Gradient Boosting machines using the Python programming language.

VU - Personalize Expedia Hotel Searches consists of a ranking problem, where a list of hotel recommendations needs to be ranked optimally based on historic data, including information on which recommendations were clicked or booked historically. This was solved using the LambdaMART algorithm, while Random Forest and XGBoost were used in the first stages of the project.
# Insights gained
From VU - Flight delay prediction I gained some relevant experience in standard classification problems.  

From VU - Personalize Expedia Hotel Searches I learned about ranking problems. This was also an introduction to a less commonly used evaluation metric: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Personalize Expedia Hotel Searches/report/Report.pdf gives an extensive overview of the approach used by me and my teammates.
